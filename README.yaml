  *WARNING: Pre-release module. Do not rely on any of the inputs/outputs remaining stable here.*
  
  Terraform module to deploy the base infrastructure for CDR Link to AWS. The deployment will be optimised for security
  by default, although some features may be disabled in order to reduce costs. The following groups of resources will be
  created:
  
  * Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  * Key Management Service (KMS) key
  * PostgreSQL RDS instance
  * Amazon OpenSearch Domain
  * EC2 instance
  
  ### Architecture Overview
  
  ![Architecture diagram](./docs/architecture.png)
  
  ### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  
  A VPC is created to have tight control over the subnets in use. The deployment uses a single AWS region, and a single
  availability zone (a single subnet is provisioned in a second availability zone due to the requirement that RDS
  instances are attached to two subnets in different availability zones, but nothing else interacts with that subnet).
  
  The deployment model intends that a zero-trust access solution is used to access the application (e.g. Cloudflare
  Access) and so all resources containing the application and application data are provisioned into a private subnet.
  No inbound access is permitted to the subnet. The instance must be managed via AWS Systems Manager (SSM).
  
  A gateway endpoint is provisioned for S3. Interface endpoints are provisioned for EC2, SSM, SSM Messages, CloudWatch,
  and KMS. Outbound Internet access is facilitated by a NAT gateway.
  
  ### Key Management Service (KMS) key

  A single KMS key is created for the encryption of all storage resources. When archiving the deployment, it is possible
  to provide the account ID to the `archive_account_id` variable to permit that account access to the KMS key to decrypt
  the storage.
  
  ### PostgreSQL RDS instance
  
  *TODO*
  
  ### Amazon OpenSearch Domain
  
  *TODO*
  
  ### EC2 instance
